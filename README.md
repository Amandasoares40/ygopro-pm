## How to play
1. Start `ygopro_vs.exe`.<br>
Note: If YGOPro crashes between games, start `ygopro_vs_lan_fix.exe` instead.
2. Click on `Deck Manager` to build your deck. Remember to add 1 _Pokemon Rules_ to your extra deck!<br>
If you do not build your deck according to the following rules, you will lose the game and have to rebuild your deck:<br>
● Your deck must be exactly 60 cards (or 30 for [Half Decks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Half_Deck_(TCG))).<br>
● There must be at least 1 [Basic Pokemon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Basic_Pok%C3%A9mon_(TCG)) in your deck.<br>
● You cannot have more than 1 _[Miracle Energy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Miracle_Energy_(Neo_Destiny_16))_ in your deck.<br>
● You cannot have more than 1 [Pokemon Star](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_%E2%98%86_(TCG)) in your deck.<br>
● You cannot have more than 1 [ACE SPEC](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ace_Spec_card_(TCG)) card in your deck.<br>
● You cannot have 4 of each half of a [Pokemon LEGEND](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_LEGEND_(TCG)) card in your deck. (e.g. 4 _[Lugia LEGEND](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lugia_LEGEND_(HeartGold_%26_SoulSilver_113))_ top half and 4 _Lugia LEGEND_ bottom half)<br>
● You cannot have both _[Professor Juniper](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Juniper_(Black_%26_White_101))_ and _[Professor Sycamore](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Sycamore_(XY_122))_ in your deck.
3. Set up the game by shuffling your 60-card deck and drawing 7 cards.
4. Check to see if you have a Basic Pokemon in your hand. Put 1 Basic Pokemon face down as your [Active Pokemon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Active_Pok.C3.A9mon). If you do not have any Basic Pokemon in your hand, reveal your hand to your opponent and shuffle it back into your deck. Then, draw 7 more cards. Repeat this process until you have a Basic Pokemon in your hand you can play as your Active Pokemon. Each time you shuffle your hand back into your deck, your opponent may draw an extra card.
5. Put up to 5 more Basic Pokemon face down on your [Bench](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Bench). You cannot have more than 5 Pokemon on your Bench.
6. Put the top 6 cards of your deck off to the side face down as your [Prize cards](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Prize_Card).
7. Both players flip their Active and Benched Pokemon face up and start the game.
8. At the beginning of your turn, draw 1 card.
9. During your turn, you may perform the following actions in any order:<br>
● Put Basic Pokemon from your hand onto your Bench (as many times as you want).<br>
● [Evolve](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Evolution#In_the_TCG) any of your Pokemon (as many times as you want).<br>
● Attach an [Energy card](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Energy_card_(TCG)) from your hand to 1 of your Pokemon (once per turn).<br>
● Play [Trainer cards](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trainer_card_(TCG)) (as many as you want, but only 1 [Supporter card](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Supporter_card_(TCG)) and 1 [Stadium card](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stadium_card_(TCG)) per turn).<br>
● [Retreat](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Retreat_cost) your Active Pokemon (only once per turn).<br>
● Use [Abilities](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Ability) or [Pokemon Powers](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Pok.C3.A9mon_Power) (as many as you want).<br>
● [Attack](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Attack_(TCG)). Then, end your turn. The first player to have a turn is not allowed to attack.
10. Before the game continues to the next player, take care of [Special Conditions](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)) in this order: **[Poisoned](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)#Poisoned)**, **[Burned](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)#Burned)**, **[Asleep](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)#Asleep)**, **[Paralyzed](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)#Paralyzed)**. Then, apply the effects of any Abilities.

**Important:**
1. This YGOPro game is only compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
2. Online play is not supported.
3. At least 1 player must have _Pokemon Rules_ in their deck, otherwise the mod will not function properly.
4. When you host a game and get an error that tells you the number of a particular card is not allowed in your deck, if there are no illegal cards in your deck it is because YGOPro does not allow you to have more than 3 copies of a card with the same name. Enable `Do not check deck` when creating a game to avoid this error.

## How to win
1. Take all your Prize cards.
2. [Knock Out](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Knock_Out) all of your opponent's in-play Pokemon.
3. If your opponent has no cards in their deck at the beginning of their turn.
4. [Some cards](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/pokemon-cards/?cardName=&cardText=win+this+game&evolvesFrom=&simpleSubmit=&format=unlimited&particularArtist=&sort=number&sort=number) will allow you to win by other means.
